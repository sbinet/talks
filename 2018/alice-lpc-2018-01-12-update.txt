ALICE-LPC - 2018-01-12
======================

Recap: the new O2 framework is a distributed framework.
It means that the default modus operandi is to have many small/not-so-small
processes (possibly on different machines) that exchange data through queues
over UNIX sockets.
One interesting side benefit is that one can write one process in one language
(e.g. C++) and another one in yet another language (e.g. Go).
The only requirement is to find a language that can speak the protocol used by
O2 so the processes can talk to each others and exchange data.

An interesting R&D activity is to explore how a language like Go, which has
nicer (than C++) concurrency programming building blocks would fare in such
an environment.
That is what "fer" is investigating.

Since last time, fer didn't see much activity in its own repo, but a fair amount
of activity happened in others, related, repos:

- go-hep/rootio updates: more compatibility (reading) with ROOT files/TTrees/TBranches
  - almost complete reading compatibility
  - most glaring missing features:
    - reading back trees with TClonesArrays
	- reading back trees with std::container<std::container<...> > (e.g. deeply nested C++ STL containers. one-level C++ STL containers are OK.)
	- writing ROOT files: this will be the focus for now

O2 can use multiple libraries for the transport of data from one process to the other.
The default transport method (the protocol from earlier) is ZeroMQ (a.k.a 0MQ).
Up to now, "fer" had only the support for NanoMsg, support for ZeroMQ required to have the C++ library installed somewhere.
That's about to change:

- development of a C/C++-free library for ZeroMQ
  - not everything is there yet
  - no performance numbers yet
  - but easy installation step (singular! `go get zeromq`)
  - this was done in the context of neugram, a Go interpreter -- not done on my ALICE time, though :)

- nice secondary benefits:
  - Go can be run in Jupyter
  - go-fer can be run in Jupyter (not tested!)
  - go-hep/rootio can be run in Jupyter
